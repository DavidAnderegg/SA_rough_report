    abstract = {The paper proposes a novel wall-function formulation applicable to any RANS turbulence model. It is based on the assumption of wall layer universality, applied to the entire model. The approach is implemented via tables for the turbulence quantities and the friction velocity uτ. The influence of numerical errors on the wall-function solution is investigated and improvements are proposed. Numerical results are presented for a flat plate boundary layer at zero pressure gradient and for a flow with pressure gradient driven separation. The behavior of RANS turbulence models in the near wall region is also analyzed. The models considered are: Spalart–Allmaras, k–ω, k–g and v2–f. The analysis of the v2–f model resulted in new analytical solutions in the viscous sublayer and logarithmic layer. The analytical solutions for the Spalart–Allmaras model can be used directly as a simple wall function.}

    abstract = {This paper describes extensions of the Spalart–Allmaras model to surface roughness, developed independently by Boeing and ONERA. They are rather simple and numerically benign, yield similar predictions, and are in fair agreement with experiments. They do not provide a description of the flow near the roughness elements, but rely instead on the “equivalent sand grain” approach. In that sense, they are not self-contained. The uncertain accuracy of the separate correlations, such as Dirling’s, needed to determine the sand grain size presents a challenge, as always. The roughness height must be much smaller than the boundary layer thickness, but the full range of roughness Reynolds number is covered. Some test cases reveal an incompatibility between the predicted effect of roughness on heat transfer and on skin friction. i.e. if the sand grain size is adjusted for skin friction, the heat transfer is too high.}
